<h3 id="where-did-you-grow-up">
  Where did you grow up?
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-did-you-grow-up">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I have grown up most of my life here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-favorite-extracurricular-activity-in-high-school">
  What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-was-your-favorite-extracurricular-activity-in-high-school">#</a>
</h3>
<p>My favorite extracurricular activity in high school was Model UN. I very much enjoyed the <em>people</em> component of Model UN &ndash; having the opportunity to interact with others, having fun representing interests that you weren&rsquo;t too particularly invested in, and just having the opportunity to travel with other club members.</p>
<h3 id="why-did-you-come-to-ut">
  Why did you come to UT?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-did-you-come-to-ut">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I matriculated to UT because of a combination of factors including proximity to family, the low financial cost it costs in comparison to out-of-state public schools and private schools, and also because of its reputation as a formidable undergraduate Computer Science program in the US.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-you-majoring-in-computer-science">
  Why are you majoring in Computer Science?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-are-you-majoring-in-computer-science">#</a>
</h3>
<p>When I was growing up, I had a lot of opportunities to use a computer such as trying to install mods for my computer games, building my own PC, or just installing more RAM. In high school, I also took a string of Computer Science classes that allowed me to learn more about the field and what coding was like. Come college application time, it seemed like the natural next step for me to choose Computer Science as my major.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-you-in-this-class">
  Why are you in this class?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-are-you-in-this-class">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I am aware that C++ is a language that has many applications in a variety of fields such as high-performance computing, operating systems, back-end systems, and so forth. I have heard from my peers that this class will give you a very thorough understanding of C++, along with healthy design and development methodologies that I hope will aid me in my career.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-expectations-of-this-class">
  What are your expectations of this class?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-your-expectations-of-this-class">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say that I&rsquo;m expecting anything in specific&hellip; I suppose the answer to this one will be very similar to the previous question &ndash; I am just hoping to learn a wide swath of industry practices, software development methodologies, and of course gain a deep understanding of the C++ programming language.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-c-do-you-already-know">
  How much C++ do you already know?
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-much-c-do-you-already-know">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I have had a previous exposure to C++ through Prof. Gheith&rsquo;s Operating Systems class. In Prof. Gheith&rsquo;s class, we developed our own operating system using C++. As a result, I know the basic syntax and usage of C++. In OS, we did not employ any of the C++ standard libraries however, so I do not have much experience with that.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-like-the-first-two-lectures">
  How did you like the first two lectures?
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-did-you-like-the-first-two-lectures">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I enjoyed them! I think I learn the best when I am able to ask about the small differences in the details, and I appreciate Prof. Downing&rsquo;s openness to ask questions, communicate, and inquire during his lectures. Even on Friday, I already learned something new that I could understand the difference of already with the use of <em>cout</em> and <em>endl</em>.</p>
<h3 id="whats-your-pick-of-the-week">
  What&rsquo;s your pick-of-the-week?
  <a class="anchor" href="#whats-your-pick-of-the-week">#</a>
</h3>
<p>My pick-of-the-week is <strong>Twilio</strong>. As services want to be able to decrease their users&rsquo; security exposures through two-factor authentication or offer better service functionality through SMS, Twilio offers an easy way for even regular CS students like you and I to integrate SMS into our projects and applications. They offer their library in a variety of languages, so it is easy to pick up and integrate.</p>
