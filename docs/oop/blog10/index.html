<p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>
<p>This past week, I attended class and was mostly focused on recruiting efforts and other classes. I did not have much of an opportunity to work as much on Darwin as I hoped to.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in your way?</strong></p>
<p>I have an upcoming Algorithms test on Wednesday that I am also needing to prepare for along with even more interviews, HackerRanks, etc. I think this project is proving harder for me to get started due to the lack of starter code and the need for handling a good object-oriented approach. In addition to this, I must admit that many times (such as during the OOP exam), the compilation errors for C++ are not as descriptive as I often hope, causing me to spend additional time researching and Googling errors.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>
<p>I need to seriously grind for the Darwin project because I have not made much progress on it. I need to set up my Species, Creature, and Darwin implementations and get I/O working. Additionally, I also suspect there will be small bugs that I will need to dedicate time debugging which might be harder to realize in this case in comparison to past projects due to the dense inter-relation of the three classes to one another.</p>
<p><strong>If you read it, what did you think of The Interface Segregation Principle?</strong></p>
<p>I did read it! I think the concepts it is attempting to convey are useful for any sort of program design, and will allow us to prevent making bad design choices which would result in unnecessary work in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of continuing to implement std::vector? (this question will vary, week to week)</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy how we attempt to implement the traditional data structures to gain a better understanding of the C++ programming language and its quirks. It reminds me of how we do the same in CS314: Data Structures where we implemented data structures such as GenericList to mimic the Java STL ArrayList and also the LinkedList programming assignment to mimic the Java STL doubly LinkedList. I think these assignments really help me gain a better understanding of how exactly C++ functions internally and what certain keywords mean in what context. One example that jumps to my mind immediately is the const keyword for methods. It&rsquo;s a small part but certainly a necessary part in order to implement any type of object.</p>
<p><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong></p>
<p>I am glad that I was able to finish all 10 papers needed for this class this week, although the papers certainly are interesting, I also do have some other work I try to get done on the weekends and being able to cross this weekly task off for the rest of the semester is a relief to hear. Beyond that, I was shocked the other day to discover we have only about five weeks of the semester left before winter break (and only three weeks before Thanksgiving break). Online classes certainly has taken its toll on me this semester and I absolutely cannot wait for break.</p>
<p><strong>What is your pick-of-the-week?</strong></p>
<p>My pick of the week this week is VESA mounts! In a previous week, I recommended a multi-monitor setup to help reduce window switching and increase productivity. VESA mounts are a standardized mount that allows you to longer require a monitor stand, but rather have it mounted directly to your desk so you can freely manipulate the positions of your monitors and re-gain some of your desk space back.</p>
