<p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>
<p>This past week, I finished my Allocator project and was able to successfully turn the project in. I finished a take-home exam in my other class, and was able to attend class and learn about Darwin, the new project that we have been most recently assigned. Additionally, I was able to make progress on recruiting and finished a few HackerRanks that I have been pushing off for a while.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in your way?</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to balance my four classes&rsquo; worth of assignments at the moment, so I don&rsquo;t think I will be able to dedicate much time to the project in the immediate future. Additionally, I am trying to think of a good object-oriented design that I can implement for my Species, Creature, and Board classes.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>
<p>This week, I need to dedicate even more time to recruiting because I have an interview on Friday (the grind really does not stop!) and continue to study for Algorithms. I have an Algorithms test coming up very soon in the future and a Virtualization project due on Wednesday. I am finding it hard to dedicate the appropriate amounts of time for each class that I need to this semester, and I need to work on that.</p>
<p><strong>If you read it, what did you think of Ethical CS?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I did have an opportunity to look over the slides for Ethical CS and I think it is very interesting. The topics of deontology and utilitarianism I am familiar with from my bioethics class, so I thought it was very interesting to see these topics applied in a different context and understand exactly how the calculus of ethics changes when applied to the development of computer programs and algorithms in comparison to biomedical research! It certainly does raise some very important ethical questions to machine learning and artificial intelligence where we as humans have opportunities to introduce implicit bias.</p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of lambdas, initializations, std::initializer_list, and std::vector? (this question will vary, week to week)</strong></p>
<p>I think that lambdas are very useful! They allow us to make more modular functions where we don&rsquo;t need to specify exactly what function we are applying to some data structure, just that we do have some function to apply. One thing I am wondering is why we would never need to capture some value or variable by closure instead of parameter? They both seem to have the same functionality: you grant the lambda scope of the variable through some certain way. For initializer lists and initializations, I always knew that the {} initialization existed but I never knew exactly what the distinction was! I used the {} style in Prof. Gheith&rsquo;s Operating Systems class and always thought it was just simply better, but now I understand that there is a very clear difference between the two. I think our implementing of vectors makes sense in my head, we need to make sure the const methods are defined as such and return the correct types, along with the appropriate constructors.</p>
<p><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong></p>
<p>Being able to say that I survived my first wave of midterms and projects all coinciding on the same week has allowed me to feel incredibly free this week. Although this feeling won&rsquo;t last long, I think it is a nice breath of fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>What is your pick-of-the-week?</strong></p>
<p>My pick of the week this week is <strong>Streak</strong>! It is a traditional CRM (customer relation management) tool that companies use to track customer interactions and such, but I have personally been using it to better track my progress in recruiting. It easily allows me to see the total number of applications I&rsquo;ve sent in, how many I&rsquo;ve received a coding challenge from, how many I&rsquo;ve progressed to the phone screen, and offer stages. I highly recommend this tool if you are having trouble keeping track of your applications.</p>
