<p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>
<p>This past week, I attended class and learned more about arrays, equals() and iterators in class. I also took my Algorithms exam on Wednesday and worked to complete a few more HackerRanks. Additionally, I was able to finish my Voting project on time and implement all the correct optimizations to get full credit and pass all 3 HackerRank tests.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in your way?</strong></p>
<p>I think I currently need to get a few other tasks done for my other classes before I can focus my attention on the OOP Project - Allocator, and also work to study for the upcoming OOP exam. Recruiting has been incredibly busy for me so I am working to balance all of this together.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>
<p>I need to catch up on my other classes and also begin understanding what the OOP test will cover. I will also begin to look at the Allocator project and understand exactly what needs to be done (such as I/O like last time?).</p>
<p><strong>If you read it, what did you think of Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?</strong></p>
<p>I did have an opportunity to read it. I think it was incredibly insightful for an individual like me who is male and also haven&rsquo;t had much experience in the professional workplace. I definitely agree that more can and should be done to be more inclusive of women in tech workplaces and think we need to be sure to go about it the right way. I thought the points it raised when it was talking about unconscious bias training potentially backfiring were incredibly interesting and revealed something new to me.</p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of arrays, equal(), and iterators?</strong></p>
<p>I think that arrays are familiar to what I&rsquo;ve previously worked with in Java, so there wasn&rsquo;t too much trouble there and the same goes for equals. The only thing in specific I found to be quite unique was the way that they are initialized and the requirement for a default constructor. I think the way that the C++ has iterators set up is quite unique. Because we can overload operators such as ++, *, and such, we have a very nice way of utilizing iterators instead of Java&rsquo;s Iterator object, in which we need to call .next(), hasNext(), and so forth!</p>
<p><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong></p>
<p>I got to get out of the house for the first time in a week or two this weekend and it was incredibly refreshing to simply be outside for a bit. It&rsquo;s easy to simply get lost in the days of Zoom University that turn into weeks that turn into months. Going outside is a great reminder to me that there exists a whole other world outside of internship recruiting and UT classes that it&rsquo;s easy to forget after a while.</p>
<p><strong>What is your pick-of-the-week?</strong></p>
<p>My pick of the week this week is <em>code review</em>! Code review is a huge part of software development where you have another pair of eyes look over your work before having it merged into the master branch. I personally think that this is something that we as students don&rsquo;t have many opportunities to practice in our classes &ndash; if we did code review for all of our projects with our peers, that&rsquo;d count as academic dishonesty so there are not many times we get to practice such a skill in our undergraduate experience.</p>
