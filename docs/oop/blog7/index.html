<p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>
<p>This past week, I attended class and had the opportunity to learn more about the various strengths of iterators, how these types of iterators applied in various scenarios, and different types of recursion such as regular and tail recursion.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in your way?</strong></p>
<p>I have become incredibly bogged down by the homeworks and projects of my other classes along with the demands of fall recruiting, and am finding it hard to dedicate the appropriate time to study for the exam and work on the Allocator project.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>
<p>I need to dedicate more time to seriously preparing for the OOP exam. I am mainly familiar with the concepts we covered in class but I see that on the exam review page, there are extra keywords and concepts I will need to review and look over. In addition to the OOP exam, I also have a virtualization project due this week and also a reading &amp; exam in my non-CS class.</p>
<p><strong>If you read it, what did you think of The Open-Closed Principle?</strong></p>
<p>I read it and I definitely do think it is a good reading. I think as students, we were familiar with the general concepts from classes such as Data Structures but I think this reading formalizes that learning in many senses of the word. It had useful points such writing code in a way that prevents old code from being modified, and new code to <em>extend</em> upon the old code thus guaranteeing that the behavior will remain functional.</p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of iterator concepts, std::array, and std::vector?</strong></p>
<p>I think the iterator concepts make sense to me! I&rsquo;m familiar from Java with the idea of an iteratoru but there certainly were new concepts exposed in C++ iterators that we did not previously have in Java like operator overloading to check the iterator positions, ++, &ndash;, write iterators, and also random-access iterators. I think that the std::array and std::vector are incredibly useful and provide functionality that is not provided in native C arrays! I do think it is rather tedious to explicitly mention that you need to use these types of data structures instead of the built-in ones. The extra functionality is incredibly handy and gives us flexibility that regular data structures won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been craving some proper tonkotsu ramen for the past few weeks and finally had a chance to get some this weekend. By golly was it every bit as good as I remembered it.</p>
<p><strong>What is your pick-of-the-week?</strong></p>
<p>My pick of the week this week is a website called Quantopian! It is an educational resource for individuals curious about quantitative finance. It provides resources like Juypter Notebooks and has an especially cool feature called backtesting, where you can apply some sort of buying &amp; selling algorithm you develop on historical stock data in order to measure how well it would have done against indices such as the S&amp;P 500.</p>
