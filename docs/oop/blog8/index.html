<p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>
<p>This past week got the chance to make significant progress on the Allocator project we have in OOP and have now mostly finished the project. Additionally, I also studied plenty and constructed a page of notes for the OOP exam. Then, I took the two-part exam on Wednesday and Thursday night!</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in your way?</strong></p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think anything is currently in my way. I only need to tidy up a few things on my Allocator project before submitting it finally.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>
<p>This week, I need to spend less time focusing on OOP and on the projects and tasks I need to do for my other classes. For example, I currently have a take-home exam in another class that I need to work on, and also the various projects and homeworks I need to finish. Beyond that, I need to continue my recruiting search and work on more HackerRanks and such.</p>
<p><strong>If you read it, what did you think of The Liskov Substitution Principle?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I did have an opportunity to read it and I think it most certainly makes sense. I believe it is a follow-up to the previous week&rsquo;s reading, because it mentioned the Object-Oriented Design article that we previously read. I think that what it covered is true. The example of the square inheriting from the rectangle because it makes sense mathematically but breaks down in programming behavior was a fantastic example of how we can apply the principle. Intuitively, I&rsquo;d also make the square inherit from the rectangle but I understand how the behaviors differ and would cause the invariants that a programmer might make about a rectangle break down.</p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of Test #1?</strong></p>
<p>I thought test 1 was okay. The concepts covered on the exam such as accumulate or the iterators were familiar to me because of what we had covered in class up to this point. I certainly do now realize how incredibly unhelpful and verbose C++'s compilation errors are in comparison to other languages&rsquo;, such as Python or Java. I definitely did spend more of my time on the HackerRanks trying to debug quirky compilation errors rather than developing actual code, simply by applying keywords like <em>consts</em> or taking them out in certain places.</p>
<p><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong></p>
<p>My current desk is pretty small and doesn&rsquo;t give me much room to have notes, a keyboard, my monitors, and my mouse on. However, I recently discovered a larger table lying around my house that I&rsquo;m very excited to switch out to! I think the extra table real estate will be very nice to have.</p>
<p><strong>What is your pick-of-the-week?</strong></p>
<p>My pick of the week this week is <strong>Hugo</strong>! Hugo is a static HTML site generator that allows anybody to super easily make their own website. The website you are reading this blog on was created using Hugo, and I didn&rsquo;t have to bother with any HTML at all. I am simply just typing my blog thoughts into a Markdown file and having Hugo take the contents of this file and transforming it into the appropriate HTML and CSS! It makes it incredibly easy to make your own website.</p>
