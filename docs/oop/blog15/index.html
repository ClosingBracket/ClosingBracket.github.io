<p><strong>How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?</strong></p>
<p>I think the course did an excellent job conveying these principles. The lectures provided a healthy introduction to the topics, while the projects and HackerRanks provide an appropriate base for us to further work with and develop these ideas. To hit point each individually, I think Professor Downing certainly does try to drill  into you to test one at a time for the tests and the HackerRanks, and the projects&rsquo; certainly do encourage you to test with both acceptance and unit tests. Regarding the existence of iterators, I think that the different types of iterators that exist is an incredibly unique and interesting thing I was not aware of the existence of before this class, but the demanding of the weakest type of iterator certainly makes sense to prevent limiting yourself in the types of underlying containers you can utilize. The same goes for on the other hand for designing your own, you should definitely be able to provide the strongest iterators possible to allow as much flexibility with your container as possible. The two points about adapters and code re-use makes sense, as it reduces code redundancy and allows us to develop classes that are cleanly implemented. I think that collaboration is valuable to the class and will discuss that later on with the two-stage quizzes and tests. Finally, I certainly do think that code refactoring and style is incredibly important for your own purposes in terms of the projects, as clean code will allow you to easily debug and modify it (and I think we can all recognize sometimes how painful debugging C++ code can be).</p>
<p><strong>Were there any other particular takeaways for you?</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have any other particular takeaways, I think the list of takeaways hits the points pretty well. Only other thing I can remark is to closely engage with the material by trying it out for yourself and seeing what happens. Experimentation is the center of human nature and I&rsquo;d argue the best way of learning anything.</p>
<p><strong>How did you feel about two-stage quizzes and tests?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed the two-stage quizzes and tests! There have been plenty of times I missed some particular question of a quiz and wanted to seek clarification from my peers as to how they understood the question and arrived at the correct answer in order to better my own understanding. The same goes for the tests, I think that  being able to talk out the problems with your peers is very beneficial to learning. I do sometimes think that the two-stage tests are a bit cumbersome however in terms of scheduling, as they require blocking off time in two days of my schedule and I think I might prefer them taking place all in one night? That is my only remark.</p>
<p><strong>How did you feel about cold calling?</strong></p>
<p>I certainly think this is an <em>interesting</em> point of the class to address at the very least. I personally enjoy the cold calling, as it forces me to pay attention closely to the material and engage with it better. It currently strikes a nice balance &ndash; because the class is so big and Professor Downing goes on rotations through the list of students, you can relax for a bit after you are called on because it will be a while before it comes back around to you.</p>
<p><strong>How did you feel about office hours?</strong></p>
<p>I very seldom went to office hours, so I do not have much to remark here.</p>
<p><strong>How did you feel about lab sessions?</strong></p>
<p>I very seldom went to the lab sessions, so I do not have much to remark here.</p>
<p><strong>Give me your suggestions for improving the course.</strong></p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the class and thought it was a very good experience to partake in. I certainly have recommended it to my friends already. The only remark I have are above regarding the two-stage tests. One other thing I might add is that we are required to create UML diagrams for our projects but never really formally cover the concept of UML diagrams in class, so some discussion of that might be helpful.</p>
