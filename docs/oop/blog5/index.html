<p><strong>What did you do this past week?</strong></p>
<p>This week, I learned more about parameter variables, return variables, references, and pointers in class. Additionally, we learned about how the use of the keyword <em>const</em> modifies each of these types of variables in programs. Finally, we began to cover a short bit of arrays on Friday. In regards to the project, I worked to get my input/output code working (which Prof. Downing says is the hardest part of the code).</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in your way?</strong></p>
<p>I am currently struggling to determine exactly how to implement the logic for the initial assignment of the votes, and the loop logic to continue until we either find a winner OR if there is a tie amongst all the candidates. I need to work more on this specifically over the weekend in order to implement and debug that logic cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do next week?</strong></p>
<p>I will work on the meat of the code for Voting, working to find the top choice after elimination. I will most likely take a hybrid approach and work to implement something between the basic implementation and the optimized implementation of the solution. I have a few other things to work on this week such as an Algorithms test on Wednesday so I will definitely need to try hard to finish before then.</p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of values, addresses, references, and consts?</strong></p>
<p>I very much enjoyed this week&rsquo;s lecture! I think it was incredibly useful and applicable to real-world code. I was very confused by the difference between a reference and pointer after seeing the Collatz starter code. However, after this week&rsquo;s lectures, I think I have a much better grasp on what a <em>reference</em> is and how if it is different from a pointer. Additionally, I got to brush up on my use of pointers in C++ and exactly how they relate to not copying the data, but providing a direct way for us to modify or access some variable in memory elsewhere. I think the specific terminology and syntax of consts was very very useful! I learned much about how consts work in C++ and how we can apply them in different ways to references, pointers, or simple variables.</p>
<p><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I received generally well responses from recruiters and engineers at career fair! It&rsquo;s definitely true that more companies are interested in working with you when you are a junior, from my experience this year. A few said they would like to follow up with me so I&rsquo;m excited to hopefully start hearing back from companies soon!</p>
<p><strong>What is your pick-of-the-week?</strong></p>
<p>My pick-of-the-week this week is virtual machines! When you&rsquo;re developing software such as drivers, operating systems, or other low-level programs, you should definitely develop it on a virtual machine and <em>not</em> bare metal. If you try developing and testing low-level code on bare metal machines, you run the risk of disrupting your workflow every time you encounter a bug or crash out of your program will crash your whole system whereas in a virtual machine, all you need to reboot the VM and revert the change.</p>
