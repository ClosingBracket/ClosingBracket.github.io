      <description>CS371p Fall 2020: Tony Chang# Where did you grow up?#I have grown up most of my life here in Austin, Texas.
What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?#My favorite extracurricular activity in high school was Model UN. I very much enjoyed the people component of Model UN &amp;ndash; having the opportunity to interact with others, having fun representing interests that you weren&amp;rsquo;t too particularly invested in, and just having the opportunity to travel with other club members.</description>

      <description>CS371p Fall 2020: Tony Chang# What did you do this past week?
This past week, I attended Prof. Downing&amp;rsquo;s lectures and got started on the first project, Collatz. At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;ve already cloned the GitLab repository, pushed my first commit to confirm the CI pipeline is working (half working because I have yet to fix the tests yet), and made my first few issues on GitLab issues for the workflow items I need to complete.</description>
